                    FontLab 8 is versatile and battle-proven. It builds on the rich legacy of our classic apps: [FontLab Studio 5](https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio-5/) and [Fontographer](https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontographer/), which were used to create 10,000s professional fonts by designers from foundries large and small: Adobe, Apple, FontFont, Linotype, Microsoft, Monotype, Canada Type, Porchez, Underware, Tiro Typeworks and many more.

                    Most fonts that are bundled with Microsoft Windows or with the Apple systems (macOS, iOS) were designed in our apps!
